# ShatterLock
C-project for semester-2

(will make a proper readme and all later, pls forgive)

to run current stable version: attempt2.c
create storage folder where you are running, also create subfolders in that and leave them empty.
can alternatively just download the whole repo.

windows: create "storage" folder in the folder where you downloaded the a.exe file in. then run that a.exe in the terminal.


linux: download .c file, make "storage" folder in that directory and compile the attempt1.c using:
terminal:
  gcc -E atttempt2.c
  gcc -C attempt2.c -lm
  ./a.out
